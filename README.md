# CloudHMI - Integrating Open Substation HMI with AI-powered ChatGPT

Welcome to a revolutionary SCADA HMI fit for substations, IoT, and a broad range of automation applications, now integrated with the power of ChatGPT.

Based on OSHMI,  we've enhanced this suite with ChatGPT integration, enabling AI-driven automation and assistance. We invite you to test CloudHMI and join us in advancing this project.

CloudHMI has been crafted with the belief that by merging the potential of various open-source projects and tools, we can develop an extraordinary, mobile, and cloud-friendly HMI system that outperforms proprietary counterparts. By leveraging the strengths of individual projects like Chromium, SVG/HTML5, PHP, Lua, SQLite, Inkscape, Libiec61850, OpenDNP3, Nginx, Vega, PostgreSQL, Grafana, and more, we've created a suite of open, evergreen, modular, and customizable tools to design sophisticated HMIs for automation projects. Based on OSHMI,  we've enhanced this suite with ChatGPT integration, enabling AI-driven automation and assistance. We invite you to test CloudHMI and join us in advancing this project.

Features and Advantages:
- Mobile and Cloud-optimized, now AI-enhanced with ChatGPT.
- Primarily designed for substation automation and control centers, but adaptable to IoT and general SCADA HMI automation applications.
- Easy integration with IoT devices and other systems via a JSON over UDP data and control interface.
- Utilizes open-source, web-based technologies and tools like SVG, HTML5, Javascript, PHP, Lua, QT, SQLite, Nginx, Inkscape, Vega.
- Strong emphasis on UX and High Performance HMI / ISA101 compatible graphics.
- Redundant operation mode support, dual server/n clients. Unlimited points, clients, monitors, and viewers.
- User-friendly configuration with simple text files.
- Supports numerous client protocol drivers including IEC61850, IEC60870-5-104 (QTester104), DNP3, MODBUS, OPC UA/DA, Siemens S7, and ICCP.
- The client web interface, powered by ChatGPT, can be accessed via modern IOS, Android devices, or an HTML5 browser.
- Reminder: CloudHMI is not a standalone protocol gateway.

Special Features with ChatGPT Integration:
- AI-powered Screen Viewer: Full-graphics, vector-based, lossless zoom (SVG) and a stunning Vega charts engine. Creates superior graphics from mobile devices to video walls.
- Events Viewer: Millisecond resolution; compatible with field or local time tags; offers 2 stage acknowledgement/elimination; historical mode - all made more intuitive with AI.
- Alarms Viewer: AI integration allows faster and smarter response to displayed alarms filtered by substation and priority.
- Trend Viewer: AI-powered real-time monitoring of measurements.
- Integrated Excel Worksheet w/ macros for streamlined configuration management.
- Historical data recording in a SQLite database, with AI-enabled data interpretation.
- Seamless integration with MS PowerBI and Tableau via OData and JSON for better data visualization.
- Lua and Javascript for server and client-side scripting respectively, now enhanced with AI capability.
- Automation functions implemented in LUA (e.g., substation restoration, tap control), made more efficient with AI.
- Features a dedicated shell capable of replacing the standard Windows Shell, restricting access to HMI functions, and integrating with ChatGPT for user-friendly interactions.
- Inkscape-based graphics editor for creating SVG graphics with SCADA animations.
- Desktop Notifications for breaker opening by protection, now with AI-powered alert interpretation.
- No browser plugins required!
